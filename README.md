 Simple Model RAG:
Retrieval Process: This version of RAG involves retrieving relevant text or data from a database or document based on a query.
Generation Process: After retrieval, the generative model processes the retrieved data to produce the final output, typically in text form.

Multimodal RAG:
Retrieval Process: In this version, retrieval extends beyond text and may include multiple data types (modalities) such as images, videos, or audio files. The system retrieves relevant information from various sources, not just text databases.

Generation Process: The generative model then processes this multimodal data to produce a comprehensive output that could involve text, images, or other forms of media.


Key Differences:
Data Sources: Simple Model RAG focuses on text-based retrieval, while Multimodal RAG integrates data from multiple formats (e.g., text, images, etc.).
Applications: Simple Model RAG is suited for tasks like text generation or question answering, whereas Multimodal RAG can be used for more complex tasks involving different types of data, such as generating captions for images or creating multimedia content.
These two approaches highlight the flexibility of RAG in handling different types of data, depending on the specific application requirements.
